## Problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

- specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows
  with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in
  read_excel
- use reasonable variable names -omit rows that do not include
  dumpster-specific data (not sure what data is not dumpstir specific)

The data include a column for the (approximate) number of homes powered.
This calculation is described in the Homes powered note, but not applied
to every row in the dataset. Update the data to include a new
homes_powered variable based on this calculation.

``` r
#decided to load the readxl library in case there are functions used in the background other than jusr readxl

mr_trash_wheel_df = read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N586") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate( 
    homes_powered = (weight_tons*500)/30 #formula based on the note in the excel spreadsheet: Homes Powered - Each ton of trash equates to on average 500 kilowatts of electricity.  An average household will use 30 kilowatts per day.
  )
```

Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda. combine these with the Mr. Trash
Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy dataset. To keep track of which
Trash Wheel is which, you may need to add an additional variable to all
datasets before combining.

``` r
#loading professor trash wheel data in the same way that Mr. trash wheel was loaded

prof_trash_wheel_df = read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M108") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate( 
    homes_powered = (weight_tons*500)/30 #formula same as it was for Mr. trash wheel
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    trash_wheel = "professor"
  )#adding new column with the name of the trash wheel 

#loading gwynnda trash wheel data in the same way that Mr. trash wheel was loaded

gwynnda_trash_wheel_df = read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range = "A2:L157") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate( 
    homes_powered = (weight_tons*500)/30 #formula same as it was for Mr. trash wheel
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    trash_wheel = "gwynnda"
  )  #adding new column with the name of the trash wheel 
  


mr_trash_wheel_df=
  mutate(mr_trash_wheel_df, trash_wheel = "mr") %>% #mutating the current Mr. trash wheel dataframe. this could be done when loading the date, but I decided to do it here because the first part of this problem does not involve adding this variable.
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) #had to also change to numeric since the other datasets were stored as numeric, so they could only merge if they were the same type of variable

#merging data into one

trash_wheels_df = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel_df, prof_trash_wheel_df, gwynnda_trash_wheel_df)
```

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in the resulting dataset, and
give examples of key variables.

For available data, what was the total weight of trash collected by
Professor Trash Wheel?

What was the total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in
July of 2021?
