## Problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

- specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows
  with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in
  read_excel
- use reasonable variable names -omit rows that do not include
  dumpster-specific data (not sure what data is not dumpstir specific)

The data include a column for the (approximate) number of homes powered.
This calculation is described in the Homes powered note, but not applied
to every row in the dataset. Update the data to include a new
homes_powered variable based on this calculation.

``` r
#decided to load the readxl library in case there are functions used in the background other than jusr readxl

mr_trash_wheel_df = read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N586") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda, and combine these with the Mr. Trash
Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy dataset. To keep track of which
Trash Wheel is which, you may need to add an additional variable to all
datasets before combining.

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in the resulting dataset, and
give examples of key variables.

For available data, what was the total weight of trash collected by
Professor Trash Wheel?

What was the total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in
July of 2021?
